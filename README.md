## Why?
The database uses the encoding `ISO-8859-9` (`latin5`) but the entered data is in the encoding `Windows-1256` (`cp1256`)

## apofix
This repository contains code to convert between these two encodings.

You can try it at https://uh1.github.io/apofix/

There is code for
* python
* javascript
* pl/sql (extraction)
* java
